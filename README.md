# ***My ToDo List***

### |Description|

This page allows you track the prgress you've made on your task list and add to it as well 

### |Using This Tool|

Type in the "Add Todo..." bar to add a task to the list and once the task is complete, simply click the task to remove it from the list

### |Support|

If you have any trouble with accessing the site or files, reach out via email to sethrmyers@gmail.com

### |The Future|

I plan to build a section that holds the removed apps to allow you to still view what has been completed
